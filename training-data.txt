hello
my names forrest forrest gump
do you want a chocolate
i could eat about a million and a half of these
my mama always said life was like a box of chocolates
you never know what youre gonna get
those must be comfortable shoes
ill bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing
i wish i had shoes like that
my feet hurt
mama always said theres an awful lot
you could tell about a person by their shoes
where theyre going where theyve been
ive worn lots of shoes
i bet if i think about it real hard i could remember my first pair of shoes
mama said theyd take me anywhere
she said they was my magic shoes
all right forrest you can open your eyes now
lets take a little walk around
how do those feel
his legs are strong mrs gump
as strong as ive ever seen
but his back is as crooked as a politician
but were gonna straighten him right up now arent we forrest
forrest
now when i was a baby
mama named me after the great civil war hero
general nathan bedford forrest
she said we was related to him in some way
and what he did was
he started up this club called the ku klux klan
theyd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets
and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something
theyd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around
and anyway thats how i got my name
forrest gump
mama said that the forrest part
was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that
well just dont make no sense
okay get it get it
wait is it this way hold on
all right
what are you all staring at
havent you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before
dont ever let anybody tell you theyre better than you forrest
if god intended everybody to be the same
hed have given us all braces on our legs
mama always had a way of explaining things
so i could understand them
we lived about a quarter mile off route 17
about a half mile from the town of greenbow alabama
thats in the county of greenbow
our house had been in mamas family since her grandpas grandpas grandpa
had come across the ocean about 1000 years ago
something like that
since it was just me and mama and we had all these empty rooms
mama decided to let those rooms out
mostly to people passing through
like from oh mobile montgomery places like that
thats how me and mama got money
mama was a real smart lady
remember what i told you forrest youre no different than anybody else is
did you hear what i said forrest
youre the same as everybody else you are no different
your boys different mrs gump
now his iq is 75
well were all different mr hancock
she wanted me to have the finest education
so she took me to the greenbow county central school
i met the principal and all
i want to show you something mrs gump
now this is normal
forrest is right here
the state requires a minimum iq of 80 to attend public school mrs gump
hes gonna have to go to a special school
now hell be just fine
what does normal mean anyway
he might be a bit on the slow side
but my boy forrest is gonna get
the same opportunities as everyone else
hes not going to some special school to learn how to retread tires
were talking about five little points here
there must be something can be done
were a progressive school system
we dont want to see anybody left behind
is there a mr gump mrs gump
hes on vacation
well your mama sure does care about your schooling son
you dont say much do you
finally he had to try
it looked easy but
oh what happened
first there  mama whats vacation mean
vacation  where daddy went
vacations when you go somewhere
and you dont ever come back
anyway i guess you could say me and mama was on our own
but we didnt mind our house was never empty
there was always folks coming and going
supper
its supper everyone forrest  my my that sure looks special
sometimes we had so many people staying with us
that every room was filled with travelers
you know folks living out of their suitcases
and hat cases and sample cases
forrest gump its suppertime forrest
one time a young man was staying with us
and he had him a guitar case
forrest i told you not to bother this nice young man
oh no thats all right maam
i was just showing him a thing or two on the guitar here
all right but your suppers ready if yall want to eat
yeah that sounds good thank you maam
say man show me that crazy little walk you just did there
slow it down some
i liked that guitar
it sounded good
i started moving around to the music
swinging my hips
this one night me and mama was out shopping
and we walked right by bensons furniture and appliance store
and guess what
this is not for childrens eyes
some years later that handsome young man
who they called the king
well hed sung too many songs
had himself a heart attack or something
must be hard being a king
you know its funny how you remember some things but some things you cant
you do your very best now forrest  i sure will mama
i remember the bus ride on the first day of school very well

mama said not to be taking rides from strangers
this is the bus to school

you know its funny what a young man recollects
cause i dont remember being born
i dont recall what i got for my first christmas
and i dont know when i went on my first outdoor picnic
but i do remember the first time i heard
the sweetest voice in the wide world
you can sit here if you want
i had never seen anything so beautiful in my life
she was like an angel
well are you gonna sit down or arent you
whats wrong with your legs
nothing at all thank you my legs are just fine and dandy
i just sat next to her on that bus
and had a conversation all the way to school
my backs crooked like a question mark
these are going to make me
and next to mama no one ever talked to me or asked me questions
are you stupid or something
mama says stupid is as stupid does
im jenny  im forrest forrest gump
from that day on we was always together
jenny and me was like peas and carrots
she taught me how to climb

sometimes wed just sit out and wait for the stars
mamas gonna worry about me  just stay a little longer
for some reason jenny didnt never want to go home

now remember how i told you that
jenny never seemed to want to go home
well she lived in a house that was as old as alabama
her mama had gone up to heaven when she was five
and her daddy was some kind of a farmer
jenny
he was a very loving man
he was always kissing and touching her and her sisters
and then this one time jenny wasnt on the bus to go to school

mama always said that god is mysterious
jenny
he didnt turn jenny into a bird that day
youd better get back here
instead
he had the police say jenny didnt have to stay in that house no more
she went to live with her grandma just over on creekmore avenue
which made me happy cause she was so close
some nights jenny would sneak out and come on over to my house
just cause she said she was scared
scared of what i dont know

he was a mean dog
anyway jenny and me was best friends

you son of a bitch run go run

he must be the stupidest son of a bitch alive
but he sure is fast
now maybe its just me but college was very confusing times
federal troops enforcing a court order
integrated the university of alabama today
two negroes were admitted
but only after governor george wallace had carried out his symbolic threat
to stand in the school house door
governor wallace i take it from that statement that
earl whats going on
coons are trying to get into school  coons
when raccoons try to get on our back porch
mama just chase them off with a broom
not raccoons you idiot niggers and they want to go to school with us
with us they do
shortly after governor wallace had carried out his promise
to block the doorway
president kennedy ordered the secretary of defense
then to use military force
here by videotape is the encounter by general graham
commander of the national guard and governor wallace
because these national guardsmen are here today
as federal soldiers for alabamans
they live within our borders they are all our brothers
we are winning in this fight
because we are awakening the american people
to the dangers that we have spoken about so many times
just so evident today the trend towards military dictatorship in this country
and so at days end the university of alabama
in tuscaloosa had been desegregated
and students jimmy hood and vivian malone
had been signed up for summer classes
maam you dropped your book maam
governor wallace did what he promised to do
by being on the tuscaloosa campus he kept the mob from gathering
say wasnt that gump
nah that couldnt be  it sure as hell was
a few years later that angry little man
at the school house door thought it would be a good idea
and ran for president
but somebody thought that it wasnt
but he didnt die
my bus is here
is it the number nine  no its the number four
it was nice talking to you
i remember when that happened when wallace got shot
i was in college
did you go to a girls college
or to a girlsandboystogether college

cause jenny went to a college i couldnt go to
it was a college just for girls
