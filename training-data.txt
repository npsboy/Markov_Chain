Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere and between celestial bodies.
It contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum of predominantly hydrogen and helium plasma, permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos, magnetic fields and dust.
The baseline temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins.

The plasma between galaxies is thought to account for about half of the baryonic matter in the universe, having a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a kinetic temperature of millions of kelvins.
Local concentrations of matter have condensed into stars and galaxies.
Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the universe, but even galaxies and star systems consist almost entirely of empty space.
Most of the remaining mass-energy in the observable universe is made up of an unknown form, dubbed dark matter and dark energy.

An astronaut is a person trained, equipped, and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member of a spacecraft.
Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including scientists, politicians, journalists, and space tourists.
In the United States, it is a designated term used by three agencies: NASA, the FAA, and the military.
The term is also used for people who are trained to fly in a spacecraft after passing certain training courses, regardless of their experience of space travel.

"Astronaut" technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality.
However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the Soviet Union are typically known instead as cosmonauts.
Comparatively recent developments in crewed spaceflight made by China have led to the rise of the term taikonaut, although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear.
In China, the People's Liberation Army Astronaut Corps astronauts and their foreign counterparts are all officially called hángtiānyuán.

600 astronauts had flown in space.
Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies.
With the suborbital flight of the privately funded SpaceShipOne in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the commercial astronaut.

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun.
It is also known as the "Red Planet", for its orange-red appearance.
Mars is a desert-like rocky planet with a tenuous atmosphere that is primarily carbon dioxide.
At the average surface level the atmospheric pressure is a few thousandths of Earth's, atmospheric temperature ranges from −153 to 20, and cosmic radiation is high.
Mars retains some water, in the ground as well as thinly in the atmosphere, forming cirrus clouds, fog, frost, larger polar regions of permafrost and ice caps, but no bodies of liquid surface water.
Its surface gravity is roughly a third of Earth's or double that of the Moon.
Its diameter, 6,779, is about half the Earth's, or twice the Moon's, and its surface area is the size of all the dry land of Earth.

Fine dust is prevalent across the surface and the atmosphere, being picked up and spread at the low Martian gravity even by the weak wind of the tenuous atmosphere.
The terrain of Mars roughly follows a north-south divide, the Martian dichotomy, with the northern hemisphere mainly consisting of relatively flat, low lying plains, and the southern hemisphere of cratered highlands.
Geologically, the planet is fairly active with marsquakes trembling underneath the ground, but also hosts many enormous volcanoes that are extinct, as well as one of the largest canyons in the Solar System.
Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular in shape: Phobos and Deimos.
With a significant axial tilt of 25 degrees, Mars experiences seasons, like Earth.
A Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years, a Martian solar day is equal to 24.6 hours.

Mars formed along with the other planets.
During the martian Noachian period, its surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, the possible presence of water oceans and the loss of its magnetosphere.
The Hesperian period was dominated by widespread volcanic activity and flooding that carved immense outflow channels.
The Amazonian period, which continues to the present, is the currently dominating and remaining influence on geological processes.
Because of Mars's geological history, the possibility of past or present life on Mars remains an area of active scientific investigation, with some possible traces needing further examination.

The Moon is the only natural satellite of Earth.
It orbits around Earth at an average distance of 384,399, a distance roughly 30 times the width of Earth.
It completes an orbit in relation to Earth and the Sun every 29.5 days.
The Moon and Earth are bound by gravitational attraction, which is stronger on the sides facing each other.
The resulting tidal forces are the main driver of Earth's tides, and have pulled the Moon to always face Earth with the same near side.
This tidal locking effectively synchronizes the Moon's rotation period to its orbital period.

In geophysical terms, the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet.
Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474, roughly one-quarter of Earth's.
Within the Solar System, it is larger and more massive than any known dwarf planet, and the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon, as well as the largest and most massive in relation to its parent planet.
Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of Mars, and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Io.
The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with only a minuscule hydrosphere, atmosphere, and magnetic field.
The lunar surface is covered in regolith dust, which mainly consists of the fine material ejected from the lunar crust by impact events.
The lunar crust is marked by impact craters, with some younger ones featuring bright ray-like streaks.
The Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, surfacing lava mostly on the thinner near side of the Moon, filling ancient craters, which through cooling formed the today prominently visible dark plains of basalt called maria.
The origin of the Moon is not clear, although it has been hypothesized to have formed out of material from Earth, ejected by a giant impact into Earth of a Mars-sized body named Theia, not long after Earth's formation.

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
This is made possible by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface water.
Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 70.8% of Earth's crust.
The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere.
Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined.
Earth's crust consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.
Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry.
It is composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen.
Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet.
The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide, creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light.
This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 14.76, at which water is liquid under normal atmospheric pressure.
Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as carbon and nitrogen to cycle.

A launch vehicle is typically a rocket-powered vehicle designed to carry a payload from Earth's surface or lower atmosphere to outer space.
The most common form is the ballistic missile-shaped multistage rocket, but the term is more general and also encompasses vehicles like the Space Shuttle.
Most launch vehicles operate from a launch pad, supported by a launch control center and systems such as vehicle assembly and fueling.
Launch vehicles are engineered with advanced aerodynamics and technologies, which contribute to high operating costs.

Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets.
Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms.
Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms.
Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000.
It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.

Mars is a dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere.
This dynamic planet has seasons, polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.
Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago.
Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars.
Instead, they're looking for signs of life that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.
Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids.
They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical.
The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.
When the solar system settled into its current layout, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun.
Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.
Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.
It dwarfs Earth's highest peak, Mount Everest.

Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water.
Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods.

There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface.
Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls.

Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon gases.
To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth.
Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets.

The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 or as low as about -225.
And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet.
If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet and winter at your head.

Mars is a cold desert world.
The average temperature on Mars is minus 85 – way below freezing.
It is half the size of Earth.
Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet.
It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.

Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather.
It has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
People would not be able to breathe the air on Mars.

While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only planet in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.
Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology.
The name was taken from Old English and Germanic.
It simply means "the ground."
There are, of course, many names for our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.

Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here.
Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time.
Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin.

As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours.
It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun.
That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days.
To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day.
That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.

Earth is the only planet in our solar system with only one moon.
Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky.
In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home.
It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.

We launch things into space by putting them on rockets with enough fuel to boost them above most of Earth’s atmosphere.
Once a rocket reaches the right distance from Earth, it releases the satellite or spacecraft.

We launch satellites and spacecraft into space by putting them on rockets carrying tons of propellants.
The propellants give the rocket enough energy to boost away from Earth’s surface.
Because of the pull of Earth’s gravity, largest, heaviest spacecraft need the biggest rockets and the most propellent.

More than 300 years ago, a scientist named Isaac Newton laid out three basic laws that describe the way things move.
One of the laws says that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
This is the most important idea behind how rockets work.
